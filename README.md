# Next day stock prediction
In this project, I utilized several Machine Learning techniques to predict whether tomorrowâ€™s exchange closing price is lower or higher than today's price. There are two types of analysis for machine learning techniques: Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis. Fundamental analysis is focused on statistical data of a company, such as financial status of the company. Technical Analysis uses quantitative parameters like daily volume, open, close, highest, lowest prices and volume of a stock. It also includes simple Moving Average (EMA) of last n days and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) which applies more weight on price of recent days. When applying Machine Learning to stock data, I used a hybrid analysis model involving both Fundamental and Technical Analysis. After collecting all related input variables, I applied Principal components analysis (PCA) to filter out unrelated variables. Several Machine Learning models were applied on selected variables filtered by the PCA in order to achieve best accuracy performance of next-day stock prediction.<br />
