# Next-day-stock-prediction
In this project, I both Fundamental and Technical data to to predict whether tomorrowâ€™s exchange closing price is lower or higher than today's price. In order to achieve best accuracy performance of next-day stock predictions, several Machine Learning models were applied on the train data, as listed below: <br /> 
Support Vector Classifier <br /> 
Logistic Regression <br /> 
SGD Classifier <br /> 
Linear Discriminant Analysis <br /> 
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis  <br /> 
GaussianNB <br /> 
NuSVC <br /> 
Decision Tree Classifier <br /> 
Random Forest Classifier <br /> 
Extra Trees Classifier <br /> 
Bagging Classifier <br /> 
AdaBoost Classifier <br /> 
Gradient Boosting Classifier <br /> 
XGB Classifier <br />
